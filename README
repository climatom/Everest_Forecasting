Overview
........

The code in this repository downloads 0.25 degree GFS data corresponding to 
the most recent model run.

The forecasts are extracted for a small domain in the vicinty of Everest, 
and are then interpolated horizontally and vertically to the coordinates
of places named in the "Locations.txt" file. 

To run
....... 

Save all code to the same directory, cd there and execute:

python MAIN.py <dir> <hours>

where:

<dir> | string: is the full path of the folder where the Download.sh
and Process.py are saved (and where all the output files 
will be stored)


<hours> | integer: is the number of hours you want a forecast for (e.g. 24)

Output: plot (.png) of temperature and wind speed for each forecast location. 



Dependencies
............
> CDO (Climate Data Operators): https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/
The following Python modules: 
> os; sys; pandas; numpy; matplotlib; datetime; netCDF4; scipy

*Note*: If Python is installed through Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
then most of these modules will already be installed already. Those that are not
(perhaps just pandas, and netCDF4) can be installed using conda (e.g. "conda install 
pandas" at the command prompt would install pandas) 

*Note*: Code will "clean" up after itself by deleting all "_GFS_*.nc" files in the 
running directory: check that this won't delete anything important before running!!
